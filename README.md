# FILM DIMENSION ðŸŽ¥

## Overview
This application is built to help the indecisive movie watcher reduce the stress of choosing between a wide selection of movies with details to inform that decision spread across many websites. This project solves that problem by taking the responsibility of giving the user information, e.g., review, scores, YouTube trailer, about movies they search for and a list of popular movies by genre to learn about so there will always be movie information provided so they can find a movie they would most certainly enjoy.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to assist people who are too occupied and stressed and have a hard time looking up information about a movie they would like to watch. It acts as a tool to solve that issue and overcome roadblocks in decision making.

## How it Works
It contains a search bar that helps users search movies which they might be interested in watching and gives critic reviews, movie ratings and a related YouTube video so the user can easily make an informed decision and will not have to worry about not watching a good movie. It makes use of 2 APIs to fetch data which is converted into JSON format and then relevant information is displayed in a format that the user can understand.

## User Story
* AS AN indecisive movie watcher, after not being able to decide on a movie to watch.
* I WANT to open the application, type in a movie then get a metascore and IMDb rating for the movie. I also WANT to search for my favourite genre, e.g., drama, action, crime, then get a list of popular movies related to my search to show up. When I click on a movie a YouTube video displays and underneath it is a summary, rating, and critic review of the movie.
* SO THAT I can select a movie that I will enjoy.
