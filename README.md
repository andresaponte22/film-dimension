# FILM DIMENSION

## Overview

This application is built to help the indecisive movie watcher reduce the stress of having to choose between a wide selection of movies. The decision to pick a movie to watch can prove to be chalenging at times when presented with a wide array of movies to choose from so some people just try to abstain from that stress. This project solves that problem by taking the responsibility of giving a summary of the movie searched and also by giving a list of popular movies to choose so there would always be a movie that the user woud most certainly enjoy.

## Motif/Motivation

The motif behind this project is to assist people who are too occupied and stressed and have a hard time looking up informations about a movie they would like to watch. It acts as a tool to solve that issue and roadblock in decision making.

## How it Works

It contains a search bar that helps users search movies which they might be interested in watching and gives critic reviews and the rating of the movie so the user won't have to worry about not watching a good movie. It makes use of 2 Api's to fetch data which is in JSON format then converts them back into usable data that the user can understand.

## User Story
After not being able to decide on a movie to watch. I open the application then type in a movie then it gives me a metascore and Imdb rating fot the movie. Then i decide to search for my favourite genre (drama,action,crime...), then a list of popular movies related to my search shows up. When i click on a movie a youtube video pops up and underneath it is a summary, rating and critic review of the movie.
